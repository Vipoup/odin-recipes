    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        When you drive through Burger King, you want a Whopper Junior with onion rings. Perhaps a double whopper with no
        cheese because you’re lactose intolerant. However mishaps happen, and you get a whopper jr with hella cheese.
        Not only is your asshole ruined, but so is their toilet. To avoid that, this is the perfect solution, just don’t
        order from Burger King. In this recipe, I’ll show you how to recreate their whooper without the cheese.

        gone put cheese on everything.”</em> -SaintBeDa 2020 </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 sesame-seed hamburger bun</li>
        <li>1/4 lb. ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2teaspoon salt and black pepper </li>
        <li>3 dill pickle slices</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ketchup</li>
        <li>3-4 sliced onion rings</li>
        <li>2 tomato slices</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped iceberg foot lettuce (<a href="./bk-foot-lettuce.html">see Burger King foot lettuce recipe here</a>)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons mayonnaise </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ketchup</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare your Burger King foot lettuce</li>
        <li>Season the Ground Beef: Start by seasoning your ground beef. Use 1/2 teaspoon of salt and some black pepper
            to enhance the flavor of the meat. The salt helps to make it taste barely unseasoned. &#128555; &#128076;
            &#128523;</li>
        <li>orm Patties: After seasoning, form the beef into thin flat patties. You don’t want them too
            <strong>THICC</strong> &#8482; because we know you can’t handle that.</li>
        <li>Butter and Toast Buns: Next, prepare your hamburger buns. Butter the inside of those buns <em>gently</em>.
            Toast both halves of the bun in a skillet over medium heat until they are lightly browned. &#129397; The
            toasting adds <strong>CRONCH</strong> and prevents the buns from becoming soggy once the burger is assembled.
            &#129316; Set those beautiful buns aside when finished.</li>
        <li>reheat Grill: Heat your grill to medium-high. This temperature is optimal for cooking burgers as it sears
            the outside quickly, locking in <em>juices </em> while ensuring the inside is cooked to a safe temperature.</li>
        <li>Cook the Patties: Place the burger patties on the grill and cook them for 2 to 3 minutes per side. The exact
            time may vary depending on how <strong>THICC</strong> &#8482; you made your patties and the desired level of
            doneness. While cooking, sprinkle a dash of salt on the burgers. This additional salt during cooking helps make
            it taste not plain.</li>
        <li>Assemble the burgers: Build your burger by placing the cooked meat on the bottom bun. Layer 3 to 4 dill
            pickle slices, 3 to 4 onion slices, and 2 to 3 tomato slices on the meat. These ingredients can be changed to
            have it your way. <em>Squirt</em> a small amount of ketchup over these, adding a classic, sweet, and tangy
            burger taste. Add some lettuce for a crisp, fresh element of foot fungus umami. Finally, <em>spread</em>
            mayonnaise on the inside of the top bun; mayonnaise adds a <em>creamy texture</em> &#128166; and balances the
            other flavors. Place the top bun on your burger.</li>
    </ol>
